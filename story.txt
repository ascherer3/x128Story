There was a boy names Bob. 
He ran up a hill with a bucket of water. 
It was cold outside.

When he reached the top of the hill he through the bucket of water.
All the water turned into snow.
He enjoyed watching snow and ran back inside to go by the fireplace.

As he sat by the fire place he looked outside and noticed that it began to snow more heavily.
He realized that his bucket of water had caused a snow storm. 
He relished in his new god-like powers over the weather.
